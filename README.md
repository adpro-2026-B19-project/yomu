Rel(admin, web_app, "Manages content via", "HTTPS")
Rel(web_app, google_oauth, "Authenticates via", "HTTPS/OAuth2")

}

Deployment_Node(docker_host, "Docker Host", "Server/Railway") {
    Deployment_Node(docker_container, "Docker Container", "yomu-app") {
        Container(web_app, "Spring Boot Web App", "Java 25", "Serves application")
        ContainerDb(h2_db, "Embedded DB", "H2", "Processes database transactions")
    }

Rel(web_app, h2_db, "Uses embedded engine", "Internal")
Rel(h2_db, data_file, "Reads/Writes data", "File I/O")
```

## 2. Future Architecture

Based on the Risk Storming exercise, we've designed a future architecture to address scalability constraints. The monolithic approach with an embedded H2 database is replaced with load-balanced application instances and a robust standalone database.

        }
    }
    
    Deployment_Node(db_server, "Database Server", "Docker Container") {
        ContainerDb(postgres, "PostgreSQL Database", "PostgreSQL 15", "Stores structured data reliably")
    }

## 3. Explanation of Risk Storming

We applied the **Risk Storming** technique to collaboratively identify, assess, and mitigate architectural risks in the current Yomu Platform. 

1. **Identify**: We mapped out the architecture and identified that the embedded **H2 Database** residing within a Docker container and relying on a Docker volume for persistence is a significant technical debt. It presents a major **Scalability Risk** because multiple instances of the app cannot safely access the same embedded database simultaneously without lock contention or corruption. Furthermore, a single container is a **Single Point of Failure (Reliability Risk)**.
2. **Assess**: Given that our platform anticipates a growing number of students taking reading quizzes simultaneously, the inability to scale horizontally (adding more instances) poses a critical risk to performance and availability.
3. **Mitigate**: We decided to mitigate this by designing a **Future Architecture** that decouples the database from the application container. We will migrate from H2 to a standalone **PostgreSQL** database. This decoupling allows us to introduce a **Load Balancer** and spin up multiple instances of the Spring Boot application (horizontal scaling), thus eliminating the single point of failure and ensuring the system can handle increased traffic securely.
